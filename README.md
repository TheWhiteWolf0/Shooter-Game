How to Play: To play the game its "wasd" to move, "r" to reload when possible, you aim with your mouse cursor, "i" For level select. Survive in a wave like level to gain power to purchase upgrades, Including Player Speed and damage and how many shots of water you can shoot.

How it Works: All scripts are original, yes I watched some tutorial but most where out dated or I needed to modify to fit my needs. GDscript is like a cousin to python in witch I have experience using so my work flow didnt need to change much or even at all.

Assest: Sprout Lands -By : Cup Noobl (just for the title sets)

Scripts: All original/self written.
